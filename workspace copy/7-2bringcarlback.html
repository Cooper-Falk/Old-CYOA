        <h1>You slowly put the timestone in the gauntlet and snap</h1>
        <p>As you snapped you think "bring everyone back" and IT WORKS, Carl is back along with everyone else. You give Carl an epic fistbump and then y'all start talking. He explained that his name is Ungrad Carl and he is a superhero. He also said that Thanos is a bad man and he wants to take out half of the population and you guys need to stop him. You replied with "your a wizard Carl." But wait, there is a problem, you brought the principle back</p>
