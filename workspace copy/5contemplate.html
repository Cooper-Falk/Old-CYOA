        <h1>You sit on the slide contemplating life</h1>
        <p>You stare at a van passing by and start thinking about everything that has happened this week.
        Then you remember something Carl, your best friend, said. He said "I know something Thanos doesn't" you asked what it was but he said he can't tell you or you'll know too. 
        You run to Carl's locker and find his backpack where you thought it would be. You open it and inside is a journal with his name on it, Carl Strange.
        You don't pay attention to it and find a old looking book. It glowing green. You rummage through the book and try to find the source of the glowing green light. You don't
        know where it is coming from. You open the book to a page.</p>
